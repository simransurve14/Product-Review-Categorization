This project aims at Classifying product reviews based on categories like quality, service and price and performing sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection on the reviews. 
The user will give the product review as the input. The first output will be the predicted category and the second output will be the sentiment of the review. 
The models in the project are trained on pre-trained models using customzied datasets for each module.

Below is the block diagram of the project:

The project is present in the 'master' branch.
** Note: The trained model files are not added in the directories due to large file storage issues. Train the models using the datasets provided to get the models in the folders. **

Steps for executing the project:

1. Download the zip folder of the project or clone the project from Github.
2. Open the 'categorization' folder and execute the 'categorization.ipynb' file. The execution will start and the model will get trained and stored.
3. Follow the same procedure for 'sentiment_analysis' and 'sarcasm_detection' modules.
4. Once all the 3 models are trained and stored, execute the 'Web App.ipynb' to combine all the modules and get a web app executed using Gradio.


I am still working on improving the project and any doubt/feedback is highly appreciated and welcomed. Thank you for visiting my repo!
